<h2>reCAPTCHA Overview</h2>
<p>A &quot;captcha&quot; is a program or test to diffrentiate between a human and a program. They are usually displayed as a garbled string of characters which humans can distuinguish easily, but computers cannot. A typical use of captchas on blogs are to prevent automated programs from filling up comment forms with unwanted advertisements.</p>
<p>The computer science department at Carnegie Mellon University designed the <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha">reCAPTCHA</a> application to harness a human's superior character recognition capabilites in the field of book digitizing with the usefulness of traditional captchas. Their website, <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha">reCAPTCHA.net</a>, provides more information.</p>
<p>To use reCAPTCHA, you must <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/whyrecaptcha">register with their site</a> to recieve public and priviate keys for use on your website.</p>

	<li>Done!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Plugin Configuration</h3>
<p>This is a pretty straight forward plugin to configure. You will need the public and private keys you were assigned when you signed up with reCAPTCHA.</p>
<h4>Plugin settings</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Enter the Public and Private keys you recieved when you signed up with reCAPTCHA.net.</li>
	<li>&quot;Registration?&quot; Check to enable reCAPTCHA on registration forms</li>
	<li>&quot;Comment?&quot; Check to enable reCAPTCHA on comment forms</li>
	<li>&quot;Email?&quot; Check to enable reCAPTCHA on email message forms</li>
	<li>&quot;Exempt Users?&quot; Check to let registered (and logged-in) users submit comments and messages without solving a reCAPTCHA</li>
	<li>&quot;Enable SSL&quot; Check _ONLY_ if your visitors are already interacting with your site over SSL already</li>
	<li>&quot;Apply Theme?&quot; box if you want to apply a different colored theme/tab index/language to the reCAPTCHA box.</li>
	<li>Choose your theme: red, white, blackglass, or clean</li>
	<li>Select the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#adef-tabindex">tabindex</a> for the reCAPTCHA box.</li>
	<li>Select the language</li>
</ul>
<h4>Plugin variables (Advanced)</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Code is set to &quot;recaptch&quot; by default; shouldn't need to be changed</li>
	<li>Priority identifies the order in which plugins are called. Lower numbers priorites will be called before higher numbers.</li>
	<li>Apply rendering? (<em>Author's note: I'm not quite sure how this variable is supposed to interact with the plugin and b2evolution. On my installation, it is set to &quot;stealth&quot;, and works for me.  Future updates may clarify this setting.</em>)</li>
<h4>Plugin events (Advanced)</h4>
<p>Leave alone unless you know what you're doing!</p>
</ul>

<h2>TODO</h2>
