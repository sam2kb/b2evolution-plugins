/**
 * B2evolution Avatars Plugin
 *
 * The Avatars Plugin allows you to attach avatars (display pictures, gravatars, profile pics, etc) to a user, blog, post and category.
 * You upload avatars within the b2evo adminstration, with either a large or small (or both) avatar images.
 * If a large avatar image is specified then lightbox functionality is seen, as when the user clicks the small avatar, the large avatar will show in a lightbox.
 * It makes use of the GD2 Image and the Gallery Plugin’s Libraries allowing for images to be resized and compressed to specified values.

    * Re-packaged with correct _images.funcs.php file
	* Stops gallery plugin conflicts even with gallery plugin v1.2.5.2-final
	* Added new setting "Display Default Avatar" if this is unchecked then NULL will be returned when no avatar is present in get_avatar

   v1.0.0.0-beta - 15/07/2007 @ 19:59 (GMT+08:00)
	* Nearly complete re-write, so it finally completes my dream of what the avatars plugin should be!
	* Removed customizability of avatar_types (no one used it, and no one cares)

	* Made it so it would detect the extension of no_avatar and use it appropriatly

	  - This is cause for extra handling of the get_avatar call (See new Usage->Part 1->1)
