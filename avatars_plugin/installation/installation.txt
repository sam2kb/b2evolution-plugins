 Avatars Plugin (for b2evolution 4.1 and up) / By sam2kb - http://b2evo.sonorth.com
====================================================

 INSTALLATION:
 
 A) Some files within b2evolution 4.1 must be modified for the Avatars plugin to function correctly. These changes are not necessary for b2evolution v5!
   You can do this manually, or just replace the files with the files included in install_b2evo_v4.1.1-4.1.3.zip (For b2evo v4.1.1 through v4.1.3 only)
   Demo evopress skin is included in demo_skin.zip
   
   For the manual approach:
   	1. Around line 291, in /inc/_core/model/dataobjects/_dataobject.class.php, you will see the the first line of hack1.txt (// Reset changes in object etc.), make it look like hack1.txt
   	2. Around line 351, in the same file _dataobject.class.php, you will see the first line of hack2.txt (// Delete this etc.), make it look like hack2.txt
	3. Around line 2330, in /inc/plugins/_plugins.class.php, you will see the first line of hack3.txt (function CaptchaValidatedCleanup etc.), make it look like hack3.txt
	4. Around line 125, in /inc/plugins/model/_plugins_admin.class.php, you will see the first line of hack4.txt (AfterCollectionUpdate), make it look like hack4.txt

 B) Upload the 'avatars_plugin' folder to your 'plugins' directory.

 C) In the b2evo backoffice, go to "Global settings" -> "Plugins" -> "Install new" -> Click "Install" for the "Avatars" Plugin.
