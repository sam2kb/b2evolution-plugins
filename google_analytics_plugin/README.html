<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This plugin puts the Google Analytics code into every page of the blog, including the Admin pages.

<h3>Usage</h3>
From Google Analytics you got a code snippet. There is an obsolete snippet and a new snippet. The plugin uses the new code.
From that code extract your _uacct or pageTracker code. It is in the form UA-1234567-1. Put that code in the settings for this plugin.</p>
