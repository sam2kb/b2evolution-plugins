<h2>MoreTags Overview</h2>
<p>MoreTags is a tiny little toolbar that will let you add some common html markup tags to your blog post.</p>
<h2>MoreTags Detailed Description</h2>
<p>MoreTags is NOT a "WYSISYG" editor. For a real WYSIWYG editor check out <a href="http://manual.b2evolution.net/Plugins/tinymce_plugin" title="http://manual.b2evolution.net/Plugins/tinymce_plugin">TinyMCE</a>. 
  Using moretags will show you the markup in your blog post, much like the "quicktags" plugin. After installation 
  moretags will create another toolbar under your "quicktags" toolbar that will operate in much the same way: you select 
  the text you want to decorate and click the appropriate button.</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="red">The colorizing buttons</span> provide spans tags for "rainbow" colors. I chose these colors (red, orange, 
    yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet) because it was easier than trying to guess what will work best with your skin.</li>
  <li><span class="red">The big/small/underscore buttons</span> provide span tags that will give you <strong>larger text</strong> or <strong>smaller text</strong> or <strong>underscored text</strong>.  Not the most complete list of markup imaginable, 
    but reasonable additions to the selection already available from Quicktags.</li>
  <li><span class="red">The heading size buttons</span> provide <strong>h1</strong> through <strong>h6</strong> tags.  If you also 
    use the "Auto-P" plugin then you do not have to type in your "return return (heading text) return" to make it post 
    correctly: auto-p and b2evolution will take care of making your post validate.</li>
  <li><span class="red">The "custom div" buttons</span> provide divs that are customizable via the back office.  The method to 
    customize is not the easiest in the world to understand, but everything has to start somewhere.  Scroll down a bit to 
    the "settings" section for an explanation of what these do.
    <ul>
      NOTE: If you don't define your custom divs and use the buttons your post will look ugly because there will be a 
      div with no meaning.  Yuck!
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You also get a special "X" button that will close any un-closed tags, not that b2evolution bloggers would ever 
    leave an open tag laying around ;)</li>
</ul>
<h2>MoreTags Installation and Usage</h2>
<ol>
  INSTALLATION
  <li>Upload the "moretags_plugin" folder this file is part of to your "plugins" folder.</li>
  <li>In your admin panel, go to the "Global Settings-&gt;Plugins install" sub-tab.</li>
  <li>Click on "Install new" (right side, near top).</li>
  <li>Locate the More Tags plugin and click "Install" in the "actions" column.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
  USAGE
  <li>As you write your blog post select some text and click the button of your choice to get colors and stuff.</li>
</ol>
<h2>MoreTags Settings (with defaults)</h2>
<p>This plugin has three settings with no default values.  All three settings allow you to define custom div tags, and 
  all three settings work the same way.</p>
<p>If you want to use a custom div you add ONLY the actual definition of the div. You do not need to add ".MT_div_1 {" 
  then your definition then "}": only the definition part.  For example, adding:</p>
<code>background-color:#87CEFA;margin:1em;border:1px solid #33A1DE;padding:1em</code>
<p>will automagically become</p>
<code>.MT_div_1 {background-color:#87CEFA;margin:1em;border:1px solid #33A1DE;padding:1em}</code>
<p>when you use the "div1" button</p>
<h2>MoreTags Credits</h2>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.tenderfeelings.be/" title="http://www.tenderfeelings.be/">Topanga</a> for testing an 
  unpublished version of this, and to <a href="http://www.innervisions.org.uk/babbles/" title="http://www.innervisions.org.uk/babbles/">•ÂﬂﬂÂ</a> for fixing a bug Topanga found.</p>
<h2>MoreTags Known Problems</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The "custom div" buttons are sloppy.  In a perfect world, the buttons wouldn't show up if you didn't define the div.</li>
  <li>It's not easy to customize the entire toolbar.  No chance to easily 
    add your own colors, or "other style attributes" or your choice.</li>
</ul>
